/**
 * com.revjet.interview.Combiner takes items from multiple input producers (think "streams" or "queues") and
 * merges them into single output. Each input has a priority (weight), which influences the frequency at which
 * elements from this particular input appear in the output.
 * <p/>
 * Example:<br>
 * if input A has a priority of 9.5, and input B has a priority of 0.5, then on average, provided both inputs don't
 * have delays in supply, for every 100 items added to the output, 95 should come from input A, and 5 should come from
 * queue B.
 * <p/>
 * Priorities make sense only if producers are faster than consumer. If producers are slower than consumer than
 * throughput becomes more important than prioritization. I.e. if high priority input doesn't produce any elements
 * for the time being, while some of the lower-priority inputs do, output should not wait for higher-priority input.
 * Instead output should be supplied with elements from the lower-priority inputs.
 * <p/>
 * Implementation notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Combiner may or may not buffer input elements internally</li>
 * <li>Combiner may or may not start internal threads</li>
 * </ul>
 *
